                The use of data is important when it comes to machine learning. 
                Although it looks different for certain companies and industries in 
                which they operate in. With the use of this data, companies are able 
                to integrate it with their machine learning systems to analyze, manage
                and overall make their data a lot more useful.

                In the retail industries, companies use machine learning systems to capture
                 and analyze the data to personalize the shopping experiences. The algorithms
                 used find the similarities and/or differences in the customer's data.
