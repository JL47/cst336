                 Machine learning can be used in various ways. Many companies today
                 use that to better interact with their users or customers. An 
                 example of this is the recommedation section of most websites.
                 It uses algorithms to track the products you've bought before or
                 items that you viewed.

                 Another company that uses this is Netflix. Machine learning has 
                 become a key component of many companies. This what allows Netflix
                 to be such a personalized service.
