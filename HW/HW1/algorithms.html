             Machine learning is such a great thing for companies to utilize, but
             it is important to recognze the complex algorithms that go into the 
             machine learning. Within the process of the machine learning, there
             are three types of learning. The first is supervised learning which rely 
             on labeled data and analyze them to create a function between them. 
             Another is unsupervise learning, which is a method that rely on inputs
             and analyze that to figure out possible outputs. The final one is called
             reinforcement learning. This allows the user/company to take the best 
             action based on the data, commonly used in robotics.
